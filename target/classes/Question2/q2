● Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
● Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example.


 1)Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
 
 JPA 
 
 JPA is described in javax.persistence package.
 It is not an implementation. It is only a Java specification.
 It is a standard API that permits to perform database operations.
 
 Hibernate
 Hibernate is described in org.hibernate package.
 
 Hibernate is an ORM tool that is used to save 
 the Java objects in the relational database system.
 Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.
 
 
 
 2)Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example.
 
an entity obj has the 3 life-cycle state:-
1.new state/transient state
2.persistence state/managed state
3.detached state

1.new state/transient state:- 
if we create a object of persistence class and this class is not attached with the EM obj, then
this stage is known as new state/transient state

2.persistence state:- 
if a persistence class obj or Entity obj is associated with EM obj, then this obj will be in persistence state.
 
detached state:-
when we call  close() method   or call clear() method on the EM obj, then all the associated entity obj will be in detached state.
